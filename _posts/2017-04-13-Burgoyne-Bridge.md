It was dusk. Her hair trembled in the warm air like the snowflakes that had now ceased to fall. We sat on an iron bench, as we had many times before---perhaps just a couple inches closer. Her voice shook. She told me of her home. The place that had robbed her of her memories had suffered the same treatment. I touched her arm, making a silent promise of safety.

The door to Arthur Bishop opened in the distance, and M walked toward us with assured strides. He gave me a warm, knowing grin.

"Ha!" He said. "So that's why you asked if I had mints."

The three of us laughed. I said nothing in return, the silence growing deeper as he walked away.

"You thought you would kiss me?" She asked, as soon as M was out of earshot.

"I wanted to," I replied, meeting her eyes, trying my hardest to look confident.

"You should," she smiled.

The long-frozen water under Burgoyne Bridge melted, filling the air with murmurs.

I took her hand in mine and kissed her.
